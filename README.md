Journal Submission for CS 305 - Software Security

This project was completed for Artemis Financial, a company focused on secure financial data management. The client needed assurance that their software was free of vulnerabilities and could securely validate data transfers. My task involved assessing a newly added checksum feature to verify data integrity and ensure secure communications. Upon review, I determined that no major refactoring was necessary, as the feature already used Java’s built-in MessageDigest with the SHA-256 algorithm—an industry-standard approach for hashing. I performed a full dependency scan and identified outdated versions of Spring Boot and Tomcat, recommending upgrades to eliminate known vulnerabilities. Determining which vulnerabilities were true threats and which were false positives was the most challenging part of the assessment.

Throughout the process, I followed secure coding best practices—avoiding deprecated algorithms, preventing hardcoded secrets, and maintaining minimal endpoint access. I used OWASP Dependency-Check to verify that no new issues were introduced after my review. These steps added valuable security layers and reinforced Artemis Financial's resilience against cyber threats. This project demonstrates my ability to assess real-world software for security flaws, implement and evaluate cryptographic protections, and apply vulnerability scanning tools effectively. I would present this assignment to future employers as proof of my practical knowledge in software security, secure development, and maintaining functional integrity while improving application security.
